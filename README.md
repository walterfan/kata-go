# kata-go

Kata should be called "routine" in Chinese. The secret of practicing martial arts is to master various routines.

First, you must learn from the strengths of hundreds of schools and be familiar with the routines of various schools in the world. Only then can you integrate them and achieve the state of no moves being better than moves.

Dave Thomas - the author of "The Pragmatic Programmer", proposed the idea of ​​Code Kata. Dave also collected a small practice project on his website (http://codekata.com/).

As a professional programmer, I hope to practice some routines that can be often used in work, such as some small routines for file modification, image cutting, and network sending and receiving, so I will organize and collect some routines here.
